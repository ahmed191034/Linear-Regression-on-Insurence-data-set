# Linear-Regression-on-Insurence-data-set
This case study focuses on developing a predictive model using linear regression to estimate individual medical charges based on personal attributes. The dataset includes features like age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, geographical region, and individual medical costs billed by health insurance. The tasks involve data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and interpretation, aiming to understand how different features impact medical charges. This practical exercise is designed to enhance understanding of linear regression within a real-world healthcare cost prediction context.
